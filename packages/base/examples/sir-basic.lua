-- @example A simple Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model.
-- This model represents a given disease that propagates over a population.
-- It starts with a small number of infected that passes the disease to
-- the susceptible ones. After some time, infected become recovered,
-- which cannot be infected again. \
-- For mode details visit http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic_model.
